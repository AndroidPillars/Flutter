## Firebase

- Firebase is mainly used to save our message data and our user details in the cloud by using their pre-built methods and classes.
- This includes things like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging, and the list goes on. 
- The services are hosted in the cloud, and scale with little to no effort on the part of the developer.
- For Documentation and Creation, Visit https://firebase.google.com/
- Now Add a project.
- __For Android,__ Create the package name, Download google-services.json and add that in the app folder.
- Finally add Firebase SDK in the build.gradle as per the documentation.
- __For IOS,__ Need a MAC machine with XCode.
- Select the IOS App and Register our App using ios bundle ID.
- For Getting ios bundle ID -> Locate the ios path folder in our application and open Runner.xcodeproj using XCode.
- Now click Runner(top of the module) -> Check the name in Bundle identifier.
- Now copy or drag and put under the runner folder in our application.
- For Flutter packages Visit, https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire
- Firebase Flutter Packages Setup Visit, https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore/install
- Now add the following packages(i.e.) firebase_core, firebase_auth and cloud_firestore
- If cocoapods is not installed we have to install using the following link, https://cocoapods.org/
- Follow this link to get installed regarding cocoapods , https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/53685#issuecomment-606981550
- Now add the following packages in pubspec.yaml file.

__pubspec.yaml__

```ruby
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.2
  animated_text_kit: ^3.1.2
  firebase_core: ^0.3.4
  firebase_auth: ^0.8.4+4
  cloud_firestore: ^0.9.13+1
```
- Now, you can enable the Authentication in the Firebase and enable the necessary field that required.
- Now Go to FireStore -> start in test mode -> choose the location and set enabled. 

## Flutter Architecture Patterns

## What is Architecture?

- If you are building an application in an organized manner with some set of rules, describe proper functionalities and implement it with proper protocols, then it is called an Architecture.

## MVC

- It is a Model-View-Controller and the most commonly used architecture. 
- MVC helps us to separates the business logic and presentation layer from each other.
- These are the three components used in MVC.

__Model__
 
- It has business logic and Data State. 
- Getting and manipulating the data, communicates with the controller, interacts with the database, sometimes update the views.

__View__

- The __View__ refers to the xml files.
- It communicates with the controller and sometimes interacts with the model. 
- It passes some dynamic views through the controller.

__Controller__

- It is Activity/Fragment.
- It communicates with view and model.
- It takes the user input from view/REST services and process request Get data from the model and passes to the view.  

## Global State 

- Global state allows you to put data into a global object that can be accessed from any widget. 
- No need to pass around state between different widgets.
- Although global state allows your data to be shared and easily accessible from different widgets, it does not replace local state. 
- They are both different and are used in different context.
- There are several different ways of managing global state in Flutter and Some of them are BLoC, Redux, Inherited Widget, Inherited Model and Scoped Model.

## Different Types of Flutter State Management

- BloC
- setState
- Provider
- Scopped Model
- Lifting State Up
- MVC
- Mobx
- Inherited Widget
- Redux
- ValueNotifier

## Provider

- In Flutter development we use Provider for state management.
- We can use it to provide a value (usually a data model object) to anywhere in the widget tree. 
- However, it wonâ€™t help you update the widget tree when that value changes.
- Add the below dependency for accessing in to the application.

```ruby
provider: ^3.0.0+1
```
