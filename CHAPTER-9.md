## Firebase

- Firebase is mainly used to save our message data and our user details in the cloud by using their pre-built methods and classes.
- This includes things like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging, and the list goes on. 
- The services are hosted in the cloud, and scale with little to no effort on the part of the developer.
